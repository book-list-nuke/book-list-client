# Book List

**Author**: Kat Cosgrove and Nick Gibson
**Version**: 3.5.0

## Overview
This is an app for the organization and storage of selected books. The back-end is a node.js server and a postgres database, deployed on Heroku.

## Getting Started
Clone the two repositories, change the environment variables for CLIENT_URL, SERVER_URL, and PORT locally in your terminal. Run npm i in the server repo, then run nodemon and live-server in the server and client repositories respectively.

## Architecture
This uses node.js for the server, express for the framework, cors to facilitate communication between the client and server, and a postgres database. The back end is hosted on Heroku, and the front-end on gh-pages.

## Change Log
See commit log, because I made about a million commits getting this running. The CSS is entirely Nick's.
